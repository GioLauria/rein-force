# Scripts Documentation

This folder documents the repository's helper scripts and Git hook wrappers. Each script used by the project has a short description, usage examples, and any platform-specific notes.

See the individual files for details (by script basename).

**Docs updated (2026-02-27):** General project runtime behavior updated (simulator defaults and selection behavior); scripts unchanged but may reference the new default artifact name/version if you build with `scripts/build_with_tag.*`.
