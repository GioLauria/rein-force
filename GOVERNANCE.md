# Governance

This repository is maintained by the Rein-Force maintainers listed below. The
governance model is lightweight: maintainers review contributions, approve
releases, and make final decisions when consensus cannot be reached.

## Roles

- Maintainers: review contributions, manage releases, and steward the project.
- Contributors: submit issues and pull requests.

## Decision making

- Aim for consensus on significant changes.
- If consensus is not reached, maintainers decide by majority vote.

## Becoming a maintainer

- Demonstrated, consistent contributions
- Positive community engagement
- Nomination and approval by existing maintainers
